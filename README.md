# terraform-google-iap-bastion

This module was generated from [terraform-google-module-template](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-module-template/).

This module will generate a bastion host vm compatible with os login and IAP tunneling that can be used to access internal VMs.

The resources/services/activations/deletions that this module will create/trigger are:

- Creates a dedicated service account for the bastion host VM
- Creates a GCE instance of n1-standard to be the bastion
- Firewall to allow TCP:22 ssh access from the IAP to the bastion
- Firewall to allow TCP:22 ssh acccess from the bastion to other instances on the network
- IAM binding to allow members to utilize the IAP Tunnel
- IAM binding granting os login to members through the bastion host
- IAM binding granting the usage of the dedicated bastion host service account
- Creates a custom role that has limited privileges to enable OS Login on an instance level
- IAM binding to the custom role

## Usage

Basic usage of this module is as follows:

```hcl
module "iap_bastion" {

  project_id  = "<PROJECT ID>"
  subnet = "<VPC_SUBNET>"
  network = "<VPC_NETWORK>"
  zone = "<ZONE>"
  members = "<MEMBERS>"
}
```

Functional example is included in the
[examples](./examples/) directory.
